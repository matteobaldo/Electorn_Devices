We start our analysis with a 1D device, we will consider the substrate a monocristal of constant p-doped silicon.\\
We will consider for oxide $SiO_{2}$ that has a high energy gap ($\simeq$8-9eV), a low concentration of free carriers, a large resistivity, a reasonably low concentration of spurious difect ($\simeq 10^{10}cm^{-3}$) but a low dialectric constant ($\simeq 3.9$).This last propriety is the cause why recently $SiO_2$ is being substituted with high-k materials.\\
In our analysis we will consider the dialectric ideal (this means we have to solve only the Poisson eq. for the electrostatic beacuse there will be no current flow) and as gate material a metal.\\

\section{Working regimes}

We start considering the 3 material isolated from each other under th.eq.\\
We will refer $E_{f(m)}\simeq E_{c}^{Si}$. we have olso to introduce the vacuum level and so electron affinity for oxide and silicon, metal work function, and silicon work function. From this data we can say that the metal we need is Al in order to mantain $E_{f(m)}\simeq E_{c}^{Si}$.\\
We olso underlined in red the potential barrier created by the oxide for holes and electrons.\\

\end{wrapfigure}

We put the 3 materials in contact after a while we will have a single Fermi-level all over the device and we can say that far from the contact p-Si will be at equilibrium.\\
$E_{f(m)}$ will move downwards toghether with $E_c^{ox}$ since the distance $E_{f(m)}-E_c^{ox}$ is constant (material dependent) as $E_{gap}^{ox}$ .
We have discontinuity of F, for Gauss law $\varepsilon_{ox}F_{ox}=\varepsilon_{Si}F_{Si}\rightarrow F_{ox}=3F_{Si}(0)$. We have a linear $F_{ox}$ for the hp of idealty of the dialectric and a parabolic band banding (that means a linear F) in the Si.\\
We have 2 voltage drops over the silicon and over the metal that define $V_s+V_{ox}=\phi_{bi}$.
If we apply a V>0 at the gate we push $E_{f(m)}$ downwards creating a higher band banding both in oxide and silicon, this band banding will increase both $V_{ox}$ and $V_{s}$ so assuming that the bulk keeps th.eq we can write the following equation
\begin{equation}
V_{G}+\phi_{bi}=V_s+V_{ox}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Flat band regime}

\begin{wrapfigure}{i}{0pt}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{mos_vfb.png}
\end{wrapfigure}

If we apply $V_G=-\phi_{bi}$ from the previous equation we have that $V_s=V_{ox}=0$ and a separation $E_{f(m)}-E_{f(Si)}=qV_G$.\\
This is the so called Flat-band condition of the mos capacitor 
\begin{equation}
V_{FB}=-\phi_{bi}
\end{equation}
Is defined as the voltage to apply at the gate to have all bands flat.\\
now we can re-write the balance of voltages as
\begin{equation}
V_G-V_{FB}=V_s+V_{ox}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Accumulation regime}

\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{mos_accum.png}\\
\raggedright


If $V_G<V_{FB}$ bands band upwards we have more holes concentration at the interface between Si-Ox than the doping concentration. \\
This is calle the accumulation regime.

\subsection{Deplition regime} 

\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{mos_depl.png}\\
\raggedright

With $V_G>V_{FB}$ we have in silicon a depletion region so we are in the depletion regime of the mos capacitor.

\subsection{Weak inversion regime}

\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{mos_weak.png}\\
\raggedright

If we further increase $V_G>>V_{FB}$ we arrive at the condition that the intrinsic Fermi level at the surface reaches the Fermi level ($E_f=E_i$).\\
From now on if we slightly increase the voltage we will have more electrons than holes at the interface. This is the condition for weak inversion regime.\\

\subsection{Strong inversion regime}

If we continue to increase the voltage applied we will reach the strong inverson regime that is characterized by $(E_i-E_f)|_{interface}=-(E_i-E_f)|_{bulk}$ so the concentration of electrons at the interface is equal to the doping concentration in the bulk.

\section{Electrosatic}

\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{mos_electrostatic.png}\\
\raggedright

We have to solve the Poisson equation $\frac{d^2\phi}{dx^2}==-\frac{q}{\varepsilon_{Si}}(p-n-N_a^-)$ only in the substrate.\\
We define $\phi_B$ the electrostatic potential of the bulk far away from the interface and we take $E_f$ that is costant as the reference energy level 0.\\
We introduce olso $\Delta \phi (x)=\phi(x)-\phi_B$  that is the change of the electrostatic potential wrt the bulk;$\Delta \phi (W_d)=0$ and $\Delta \phi (0)=V_s$.\\
Now we have to write $p-n-N_a^-$ as function of $\phi(x)$.\\
For electrons we can say that $n=n_ie^{q(E_f-E_i)/kT}$ if we multiply and divide by q we get $n=n_ie^{q\phi(x)/kT}$ same for holes as $n=n_ie^{-q\phi(x)/kT}$. Electrons and holes in the bulk are $n_0=n_ie^{q\Delta \phi/kT}$ and $p_0=n_ie^{-q\Delta \phi/kT}$. From this 4 equation we can write that 
\begin{equation}
n=n_0e^{q\Delta \phi/kT} \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ p=p_0e^{-q\Delta \phi/kt}
\end{equation}
In the bulk we can say ythat $p_0=n_0+N_a$ so 
\begin{equation}
N_a=p_0-n_0
\end{equation}
Now Poisson equation becomes 
\begin{equation}
\frac{d^2\phi}{dx^2}==-\frac{q}{\varepsilon_{Si}}(p_0e^{-q\Delta \phi/kt}-n_0e^{q\Delta \phi/kT}-p_0+\frac{n_i^2}{p_0})
\end{equation}
Until now the only approximation we have made is the M-B. Now we consider the complete ionization approximation $p_0\simeq N_a$. And we make a change of variable 
\begin{equation}
\frac{d^2\phi}{dx^2}==-\frac{q}{\varepsilon_{Si}}(N_ae^{-q\Delta \phi/kt}-\frac{n_i^2}{N_a}e^{q\Delta \phi/kT}-N_a+\frac{n_i^2}{N_a})
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
d(\frac{d\phi}{dx})==-\frac{q}{\varepsilon_{Si}}(N_ae^{-q\Delta \phi/kt}-\frac{n_i^2}{N_a}e^{q\Delta \phi/kT}-N_a+\frac{n_i^2}{N_a})dx
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\frac{d\phi}{dx}d(\frac{d\phi}{dx})==-\frac{q}{\varepsilon_{Si}}(N_ae^{-q\Delta \phi/kt}-\frac{n_i^2}{N_a}e^{q\Delta \phi/kT}-N_a+\frac{n_i^2}{N_a})dx\frac{d\phi}{dx}
\end{equation}
Now we integrate one time this expression. The first member is like f(x)f'(x) so the result is $-1/2(\frac{d\phi}{dx})^2$. Integrating olso the second member and gathering the common terms the equation we get
\begin{equation}
(\frac{d\Delta \phi }{dx})^2=\frac{2kTN_a}{\varepsilon_{si}}\left(e^{-q\Delta \phi/kT}+\frac{q\Delta \phi}{kT}-1+\frac{n_i^2}{N_a^2}(e^{q\Delta \phi/kT}-\frac{q\Delta \phi}{kT}-1)\right)=F^2(x)
\end{equation}
For Gauss law $F_s=F(0)=-\frac{Q_s}{\varepsilon_{si}}$ from this relation and the previous equation we get
\begin{equation}
Q_s=\pm\sqrt{2kTN_a\varepsilon_{si}}\left(e^{-qV_s/kT}+\frac{qV_s}{kT}-1+\frac{n_i^2}{N_a^2}(e^{qV_s/kT}-\frac{qV_s}{kT}-1)\right)^{1/2}
\end{equation}
We already know the total charge in the substrate for all working regimes.\\

\subsection{Dominant terms in the solution of Poisson equation}

\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{logqVs.png}\\
\raggedright

To better undestand this formula let's analyse all working regime separately and draw a $\log |Q_s| - V_s$ graph.\\

\tab \tab In accumulation regime when $V_s<0$ we have that $Q_s\simeq \sqrt{2kTN_a\varepsilon_{si}}e^{-\frac{qV_s}{2kT}}$. So in the graph we see a straight line dependence. We can say that the term
\begin{equation}
e^{\frac{-qV_s}{kT}}\rightarrow h_{sub}
\end{equation} 
in the solution of the Poisson equation is the term that takes into account for hole concentration in the substrate.\\
\tab \tab In the depletion regime $0<V_s<2\phi_b$ we have to consider two dominant term: $\frac{qV_s}{kT}$ and $\frac{n_i^2}{N_a^2}e^{\frac{qV_s}{kT}}$. If we evaluate the second term at $2\phi_b$ we get 1 so it's negligible and therefore the first term is predominant. In this regime
\begin{equation}
Q_s\simeq -qN_a\sqrt{\frac{2\varepsilon_{Si}}{q}\frac{1}{N_a}V_s}
\end{equation}
that is the charge of the depletion layer.\\
\tab \tab In strong inversion $Q_s\simeq \sqrt{2kTN_a\varepsilon_{si}}\frac{n_i^2}{N_a^2}e^{\frac{qV_s}{2kT}}$ so we can say that the term
\begin{equation}
\frac{n_i^2}{N_a^2}e^{\frac{qV_s}{kT}}\rightarrow e_{sub}
\end{equation}
in the solution of the Poisson equation is the term that takes into account electrons in the substrate.\\

\subsection{Total charge in function of gate bias}
We want $Q(V_g)$ ; to have that expression we need to remember that $V_g-V_{fb}=V_s+V_{ox}$ but we can write $V_{ox}=F_{ox}t_{ox}=Q(V_s)/C_{ox}$ using this expression and $Q(V_s)$ we can get what we want.\\

\section{Small signal capacitance}
We want to study the small signal capacitance of the MOS capacitor that is a non linear device so we want $C_g=-\frac{dQ_s}{dV_g}$ the change of charge over the change of voltage.\\
We can guess the behaviour of $C_g$ using the expression $V_g-V_{fb}=V_s-Q_s/C_ox$ and calculating the derivative wrt $dQ_s$ we get
\begin{equation}
\frac{dV_g}{d(-Q_s)}=\frac{dV_s}{d(-Q_s)}+\frac{1}{C_ox}
\end{equation}
that is 
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{C_g}=\frac{1}{C_s}+\frac{1}{C_{ox}}
\end{equation}
The total gate capacitance can be expressed by the series of 2 resistance one fixed the $C_{ox}$ one variable that is the substrate capacitance $C_s$. From this we know that $C_g$ has an upper limit of $C_ox$.\\
Let's analise the small signal capacitance in the various regime.\\

\subsection{in accumulation regime}
We derivate the charge of the accumulation region obtaining 
\begin{equation}
C_s=\sqrt{2kTN_a\varepsilon_{si}}e^{-\frac{qV_s}{2kT}\frac{q}{2kT}}=Q_s/\frac{2kT}{q}
\end{equation}
Knowing $Q_s(V_g)$ we get 
\begin{equation}
C_s=\frac{C_{ox}(V_{fb}-V_g)}{2kT/q}
\end{equation}
This is $>>C_{ox}$ if $V_{fb}-V_g>>2kT/q$. So from flat band to minus infinite the capacitance increases and becomes similar to $C_{ox}$. We are close to a metal plate capacitor.\\

\subsection{in flat band condition}
We have to include in the Q expression both electrons and holes so $Q_s=\sqrt{2kTN_a\varepsilon_{si}}(e^{\frac{-qV_s}{kT}+\frac{qV_s}{kT}-1)^{1/2}$. If we make the Taylor expansion of the exponential term around 0 we get $Q_s=V_s\sqrt{\frac{\varepsilon_{si}q^2N_a}{kT}}$ so 
\begin{equation}

\end{equation}
